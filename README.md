# Musketeers-project 

In this readme file will all info about our project displayed.

## The project itself

This project is setup to be a collaberation with friends who are liking to have a little challenge. We hope that we will learn a lot through out this proces of making a game.

## Instructions

1. First you need to create a new branch to put your updated stuff in. Branches are like sandboxes so the code split from each other so you can work safely on new updates. When you are sure the code is bug free you can merch it with the master branch and delete the branch you were working in.
